                    <p>Writing your own story is one step for you to know yourself better.All you need to have is paper and pen to write down your thoughts, your feelings, and your experiences where you have learned a lot. You learn from your mistakes and you can freely admit to yourself what are the truth about you.</p>

                    <p>A simple note for your experiences and what you feel will evaluate you and tell you that there are more things that you need to do, there is still a long journey that you must take. You're writing a simple diary to jot down and pour all the things that you keep to yourself, the things that you cannot tell to other people and you can only expressed it when you write it down.</p>

                    <p>You can write your life story and be your master piece. Your life story tells all about who you are and the greatest obra that you can make is to map your own story.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">I began writing</h2>

                    <p>I started writing when I was still in elementary. I don't have many companions and friends because I prefer to stay alone. I usually leave my class because I don't want to stay in school. I always want to be absent because I don't want to be with other kids and I want a quiet environment.</p>

                    <p>I usually write when I am alone and make stories on my own. I love writing life stories and fiction stories. Whenever I'm sad, I'm happy, or I'm in trouble, I write. I 'm not so much in talking with other people that's and my best way to express my own thoughts is through writing.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Better to write for yourself and have no public, <br>
                    than to write for the public and have no self.
                    -Cyril Connolly"</blockquote>

                    <p>I know that in writing I can be myself. I can explore things that I cannot do in the physical world and through writing I can voice out what's in my mind.</p>

                    <blockquote>"Quiet people have the loudest minds.-Stephen King"</blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">I never dreamed to be writer</h2>

                    <p>As far as I know I never dreamed to be a writer. I only start writing because I'm not that sociable and only paper listens. I tried to be as friendly as other children do but I just can't do the thing. I'm not as famous as any writers do but I'm being different in my own way of writing.</p>
                    <p>As one of the writers said, you can never start and learn how to write if you don't even try to write a word. They say, you can only learn how to write if you turn on the faucet. I was once like this, a person scared to write but eventually I learned how to write because I tried to do it. I made my life as my inspiration and I became honest to myself, admitting all my mistakes and what I really feel.</p>

                    <p>I may not be the best writer but I can proudly say that I'm unique as the other writers do. I have my own way of writing style, my own way of writing skills and through writing I became free.</p>
