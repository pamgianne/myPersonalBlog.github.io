                <p>I am Pamela Tamayo Montilla, 18 years old. I am studying in University of the Cordilleras, Baguio City. I was born in Sugpon Ilocos Sur. I studied in Sugpon Central School for five years, from grade 1 - grade 5 and transfered in Banooy Elementary School, Baculongan Norte, Buguias Benguet and finished  my last year in elementary. That year left me a lot of good memories. That year was the last year that I saw my parents living together with us, at last, a complete family I thought. My father worked as a carpenter and finishing masson. Because of his work, he is always away from us. Even when I was still young, I seldom saw him went home early because of his work. </p>
                <p>My parents left me to my grandparents when I was only 2 months old and went to Manila. I was raised by my patient and loving aunts and uncles, together with my dearest Lolo and Lola. My Mom and Dad came back when I was already 2 years old and of course, I can't recognize them because I thought my parents are my grandparents because they are the one who took care  of me. But then, they told me that they are my parents and believed them. </p>
                <p>Another sad story, that was when they left me again to my grandparents and they went to Manila with my younger sister, Gift. I was already 8 years old that time. Yes, that time a, child like me can't do anything but to cry, and to say  "GOODBYE, take care and promised to come back for me."</p>
                <p>Well, that's my life of being left, but after all these years, I already accepted the fact that they left me for a big reason and that is to find a better life. That's a pretty sad story and now I realize that those things could be the reason why I seldom attend my classes, cutting classes or scaping, and fighting with my schoolmates. I was so impatient, always tempted  to hurt other students and so on. My teachers told me that I can perform good in school but I always fail to pass. </p>
                <p>Those are the days of my childhood. Having a lot of bad records in school, failing grades, a lot of enemies, absenter, scaper, and more. They even called me a Lesbian, that's how rebellious I am when I was young. </p>
                <p>Another story is when I was already in high school. My mother sent me to Baguio to study. Yes, young as I am, always far from my family. I studied in Baguio City National High School for three years and my Aunt and Uncle spent for my schooling. During the last year in that school, our family situation became complicated. My Mom and that Dad then separated. I transfered again in my home town, Sugpon Ilocos Sur and finished my last year in high school. Within that year, I experienced the most complicated situation in my life that has never been before. We are suffered with my two sisters in vain because of what happened to our family. I changed a lot. I became hot-tempered, impatient, and there are many questions in my mind that I would very much like to find the answers. Why did this tragedy happened to my family? Why do we need to suffer? Why did our our father left us? Why did they broke our family? Are they not thinking of us? Well I guest, all the things that happened are just trials/challenges and we need to face it bravely with strong faith. </p>
                <p>Just as the word of Jehovah states in Psalm 27:10 "Even my own father and mother abandon me, Jehovah himself will take me in." This verse always give me hope, always strengthen me and always encourage me to go on. Under difficulties,for example we lack finacial needs and sometimes we even don't have allowance in school, we pray, me make remedies like selling some of our products to help our mother. We sell our pets, and I even sell my shool works to my classmates just to earn something for us. It's quite difficult but we still survived. Well everything is hard, but it's up to the person if he/she makes it more complicated or to solve it in a wise way. </p>
                <p>I did not stand alone, I found help not only in man's hand but more my Heavenly Father, Jehovah. He listened to all my prayers. He sustained all my needs. He strengthen me, comforted me, and gave me hope in the times that I'm depressed. Another verse from the Bible that helped me was in 1 Peter 5:7. It states, "While you throw all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you." Yes, Jehovah really cares for me and I proved it in the times when I am empty, left, and tested. A real test of faith.
